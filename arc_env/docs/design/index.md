# Design Documents

This section contains documents outlining the design principles, architecture, and key decisions made during the development of the `arc_env` package.

Understanding these documents can be helpful for:
*   Contributors looking to understand the codebase structure and extend it.
*   Users who want a deeper insight into how different components work and interact.
*   Researchers interested in the rationale behind certain design choices.

## Available Documents

1.  **[Package Architecture](./architecture.md)**
    *   An overview of the main modules and their responsibilities.
    *   How components like the environment, spaces, DSL, data loaders, and solvers are interconnected.
    *   Key abstractions and interfaces.

2.  **[Action Space Design](./action_space_design.md)** (Placeholder)
    *   Rationale for factorized vs. joint action space modes.
    *   Design of the DSL operation registry and presets.
    *   Considerations for extensibility of actions.

3.  **[Observation Space Design](./observation_space_design.md)** (Placeholder)
    *   Structure of the `ARCStructuredObservation`.
    *   Choices regarding the representation of training pairs and task context.
    *   Potential for observation wrapping and normalization.

4.  **[Data Management Layer Design](./data_layer_design.md)** (Placeholder)
    *   Design of `BaseDataLoader` and concrete loader implementations.
    *   Approach to data processing, validation, and augmentation.

    *   Evaluation and benchmarking pipeline design.

6.  **[Configuration Management](./configuration_design.md)** (Placeholder)
    *   Design of `BaseConfig` and specific configuration classes.
    *   Mechanisms for loading, validating, and merging configurations.

7.  **[Error Handling and Logging Strategy](./error_logging_design.md)** (Placeholder)
    *   Overview of custom exceptions (`arc_env.exceptions`).
    *   Approach to logging within the package.
