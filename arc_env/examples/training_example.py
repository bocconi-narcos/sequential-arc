training_example.py

A high-level conceptual example of how one might train an RL agent
using the ARCEnv. This example does NOT include a specific RL framework
implementation (like Stable Baselines3, RLlib, Tianshou, etc.) as that's
a separate dependency and setup.

It outlines the typical components:
- Environment setup.
- Agent/Solver setup (if the solver is learnable, e.g., an RL policy).
- A conceptual training loop.
- Saving the trained agent/solver.
