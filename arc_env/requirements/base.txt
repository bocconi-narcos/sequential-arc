# Core dependencies for the arc_env package
# These should generally match the `dependencies` section in pyproject.toml

gymnasium>=0.26.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# Add other core runtime dependencies here as they are identified.
# For example, if a specific image processing library is always needed for rendering
# or core operations (though rendering dependencies are often optional).
# Example:
# pygame>=2.1.0 # If pygame is a core rendering dependency
# scikit-image # If used for core grid_utils like object detection

# Note: It's good practice to pin versions more specifically for reproducible builds,
# e.g., gymnasium==0.29.1, numpy==1.26.0, or use a lock file generator like pip-tools.
# For a library, using minimum supported versions (>=) is common.
