# Domain-Specific Language (DSL)

This section describes the Domain-Specific Language (DSL) used in the Sequential ARC project.

The DSL is divided into the following components:

* **[Colour](./colour.md):** Functions for selecting colours from the grid.
* **[Selection](./select.md):** Functions for selecting a set of cells from the grid.
* **[Transformation](./transform.md):** Functions for applying transformations to the selected cells.
